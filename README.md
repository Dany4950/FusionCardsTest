Hi I have Created a geolocator application in flutter for the evaluation purpose , it detects your exact location and then shows the available merchants nearby 
steps to access this :
1. clone the repository in your local host and in the main.dart file at top right you would have a run option.
2. select the desired emulator or simulator . 
3. click on run without debugging and toggle the needed permissions and you are good to go.
